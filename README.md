This *notebook* contains my solution to **Individual Project 1**.  
**Goal:** Write a Python program that reads from a file and performs simple data manipulation and display with Numpy and PrettyTable.  
- Problem A: Write a function that will accept a filename and implement the code to open and read the parking.csv file into a list.  
- Problem B: Write a function that accepts a list and prints a PrettyTable of the data with the first row of the data as the header row.  
- Problem C: Write a function that accepts a list and the lot type and returns a tuple that contains the lot type and the number of the lots of that type.  
-Problem D: Write a function that accepts a list and column position and returns the Max, Min, and Average for that column.
